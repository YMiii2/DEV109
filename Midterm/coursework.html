            <h2>History of Western Art (ART 203)</h2>
            <p>The History of Western Art (ART 203), taught by Dr. Melanie Enderle, has been an important course that influenced my understanding of art and its significance throughout history. BeforeÂ this class, my knowledge of Western art was limited, with an emphasis on its aesthetic worth. However, this course provided me with a thorough understanding of the historical, cultural, and social circumstances that impacted the evolution of Western art.</p>
